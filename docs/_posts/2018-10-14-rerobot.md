After almost a year absent from the robot project, we ( [Erik] and [Jimmy] ) decided to reboot our robot project. This time with a more ambitious agenda. We will spend a day every week in a workshop, for a target of six months, learning about robots and other cool IT.

[Erik]:s intentions i to understand how to build a proper robot using ROS.
[Jimmys]: intentions seems to be about the same, except messing around alot more with god knows what IT.

There is a chance we'll end up us drinking beer aswell (or instead?)...

# Our work
* Organizing our work takes place on GitHub, so it will be easy to track our work in this repo initially. "Robojoy".
* We plan our activity using "Issues" and "Milesontes". One milestone per week.

# This week milestone (M2)
Check out the items from [Milestone 2](https://github.com/erik78se/robojoy/milestone/3)
